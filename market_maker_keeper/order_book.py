        orders: Current list of active keeper orders. This list is already amended with
            recently placed orders, also recently cancelled orders or orders being currently cancelled
            are not present in it.

        balances: Current balances state. This field only has value when balance retrieval function
            has been configured by invoking  OrderBookManager.get_balances_with()`. Otherwise it's always
            None. Currently, the balances state is not updated with order placement and cancellation
            (unlike `orders`) so it may (and will) happen that `orders` and `balances` will get out of sync.
            There are no serious consequences of it, keeper may be trying to place orders with money
            it doesn't have yet, which will of course fail, but the state will be rectified the
            next time a successful orders/balances sync takes place.

        orders_being_placed: `True` if at least one order is currently being placed. `False` otherwise.
            Orders which are currently being placed are not included in `orders`. They will only get
            included there the moment order placement succeeds.

        orders_being_cancelled: `True` if at least one orders is currently being cancelled. `False` otherwise.
            Orders which are currently being cancelled are immediately removed from `orders`. Having said that,
            they will 'reappear' there again if the cancellation fails. It's the keepers responsibility
            to notice them and try to cancel them again.

class OrderBookManager:
    """Order book manager allows keeper to track state of the order book without constantly querying it.

    Some exchange APIs are not very good in responding to API requests. If a place order API call
    periodically fails it's not such a big deal for the keeper, but if a `get_orders()` call starts
    to fail for a few minutes this can have tremendous consequences if the keeper relies on that
    call directly. For example the keeper may not be able to cancel orders as the price moves.

    Order book manager allows to decouple the keeper from directly depending on the `get_orders()` call
    in order to be aware of the current state of its orders. It queries the order book periodically
    in background, allowing the keeper to get the latest snapshot of it. In addition to that, for orders
    placed or cancelled via the order book manager it can update this internal snapshot by 'forgetting'
    the cancelled ones and 'amending' the snapshot with the newly placed ones. See the `OrderBook` class.

    This way, as long as the `place_order()` call is able to return the id of the newly placed order,
    the keeper can cancel these orders even if no `get_orders()` call has been successful since then.

    Order book manager can also optionally query the balances and include them in the snapshot,
    along querying the order book.
